When using the socket API, make sure the can network interface is up.
Using wireshark on the can network interface is possible, but it lacks a
dissector. The raw data decodes like this:
can id: 4 byte in host byte order. See /usr/include/linux/can.h for decoding the
        high 3 bits and /usr/include/linux/can/error.h for error packets.
length: 1 byte
garbage?: 3 byte
can data: 8 byte
